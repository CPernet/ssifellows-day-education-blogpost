# Teaching programming at universities
> SSI fellows' education blog

## Context

_When_: The SSI fellowship selection day (November 2, 2016) involved several sessions including group dicussions. The group discussion was about education and software.

_Who_: The group was composed of Dr Laurence Billingham, Dr Elena Vataga, Dr Krishna Kumar, Dr Cyril Pernet.

_What_: The discussion was about teaching programming and best practices at universities: whom we should teach, what should be taught and when.

## Why
There are two primary reasons to teach programming and best practice to the widest possible community.

Firstly, we now live in a digital society and knowing how computers and the web work is now considered a form of [literacy](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/government-digital-inclusion-strategy/government-digital-inclusion-strategy).

Secondly learning how to think like a software developer gives people powerful new ways of explore ideas. Learning to code can change the way people think about the world and their place in it. Any programming language is a set of rules, but, through the act of learning the rules of the system and mastering the language, programmers acquire the ability to understand and modify the system. For more on deconstructing and improving broken systems we recommed you check out [Jessica McKellar's PyBay2016 Keynote](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UnMZYMaosw).


## General idea

We unanimously agreed that programming and best practices has to be taught at every level in universities, catering to different needs of the people, and has to start at the undergraduate level. At the undergraduate level, we recommend teaching algorithmic/programming thinking, and not dedicated software applications, emphasising the idea of learning to think and not learning to code.  More emphasis should be on best practices such as writing good code documentation and manuals, version control systems and at the same time, favour social aspects such as pair programming and code review. These are the kind of skills which are essential as a programmer, but can be transferred easily across disciplines. Such courses can be run across schools, to promote the idea that this is a transferable skill that is useful, beyond coding.

We agreed that domain specific programming and specific software applications should be taught at masters level in respective schools and departments. More good practices like unit testing should be included in the curriculum.

## Curriculum example

|  *Level*       | *Tools*          | *Good Practices*                     | *Domain Specific*           |
|:--------------:|:----------------:|:------------------------------------:|:---------------------------:|
| Undergraduates | Version control  |  exercice based programming thinking |                             |
|                | editors          |   Code documentation and manuals     |                             |
|                |                  |  collaborative/social 'coding'       |                             |
|                |                  |    `To run accross departments / schools` 			 |
| Masters / PhD  | python, R, matlab |    more doc + unit-testing          |   specific applications     |
|		 |		    |`To run within departments / schools`                               |
| PhD++          |                  |                                      |  applications / libraries   |
|                |                  |`To run as a workshop around conference / hackaton style` 		 |

## Conclusions

Hopefully, in 20 years from now, teaching programming thinking won't be necessary at universities, as the UK has made it a part of their [official curriculum](http://www.computingatschool.org.uk/) for all grade school kids.
