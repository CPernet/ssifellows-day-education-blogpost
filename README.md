# Teaching programming outisde computer science departments

By [Cyril Pernet](https://www.software.ac.uk/fellows/cyril-pernet), [University of Edinburgh](http://www.ed.ac.uk/), [Krishna Kumar](https://www.software.ac.uk/fellows/krishna-kumar), [University of Cambridge](http://www.cam.ac.uk/), [Laurence Billingham](https://www.software.ac.uk/fellows/laurence-billingham), [British Geological Survey](http://www.bgs.ac.uk/).

## Context

_When_: The [Software Sustainability Institute](https://www.software.ac.uk/) [Fellowship face-to-face selection day](https://www.software.ac.uk/blog/2016-11-29-fellows-2017-face-face-selection-day) (November 2, 2016) involved several sessions including group dicussions. The group discussion was about education and software.

_Who_: The group was composed of [Dr Laurence Billingham](https://www.software.ac.uk/fellows/laurence-billingham?_ga=1.121182797.437377340.1489057524), [Dr Elena Vataga](http://cmg.soton.ac.uk/people/ev1r09/), [Dr Krishna Kumar](https://www.software.ac.uk/fellows/krishna-kumar?_ga=1.121182797.437377340.1489057524), [Dr Cyril Pernet](https://www.software.ac.uk/fellows/cyril-pernet?_ga=1.121182797.437377340.1489057524).

_What_: The discussion was about teaching programming and best practices at universities: whom we should teach, what should be taught and when.

## Why

There are two primary reasons to teach programming and best practice to the widest possible community.

Firstly, we now live in a digital society and knowing how computers and the web work is now considered a form of [literacy](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/government-digital-inclusion-strategy/government-digital-inclusion-strategy) just like English and mathematics. Be [digital literated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_literacy) is [important](http://purposefultechnology.weebly.com/why-is-digital-literacy-important.html) because it allows individuals to be more responsible on how they use and interact on our digital age, and impowers them to better communicate and work.

Secondly learning how to think like a software developer gives people powerful new ways of explore ideas. Learning to code can change the way people think about the world and their place in it. Any programming language is a set of rules, but, through the act of learning the rules of the system and mastering the language, programmers acquire the ability to understand and modify the system. For more on deconstructing and improving broken systems we recommed you check out [Jessica McKellar's PyBay2016 Keynote](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UnMZYMaosw).

## General idea

We unanimously agreed that programming and best practices has to be taught at every level in universities, catering to different needs of the people, and has to start at the undergraduate level. At the undergraduate level, we recommend teaching algorithmic/programming thinking, and not dedicated software applications, emphasising the idea of learning to think and not learning to code.  More emphasis should be on best practices such as writing good code documentation and manuals, version control systems and at the same time, favour social aspects such as pair programming and code review. These are the kind of skills which are essential as a programmer, but can be transferred easily across disciplines. Such courses can be run across schools, to promote the idea that this is a transferable skill that is useful, beyond coding.

We agreed that domain specific programming and specific software applications should be taught at masters level in respective schools and departments. More good practices like unit testing should be included in the curriculum.

## Challenges

The challenges to implement our curriculum example are two folds.  

First, is trying getting schools to have common teaching. In the academic world, research collaborations have no departmental, school, university, or country borders. When it comes to teaching, this is completely different, each department oversees its students. That means that to run such a course, you need teachers from different departments and schools to organize this, keeping things easy at the administrative level. For students, it should be easy enough as undergraduates have more common knowledge than not - and this will make them realize that common tools and practices exist across the range of professional activities.  

Second, is convinced graduate and post-graduate schools that coding skills are generic and translational skills. Once you have that, you teach it like teaching about writing a good article. Currently there is still too little recognition that coding is a generic skill and thus it remains inside labs, taught locally from PI to student or student to student. It doesn't allow to take full benefit of being in a university with colleagues from computer science who can help. Only by pushing coding as a generic skill, one can improve our studentâ€™s skills.


## Conclusions

Hopefully, in 20 years from now, teaching programming thinking won't be necessary at universities, as the UK has made it a part of their [official curriculum](http://www.computingatschool.org.uk/) for all grade school kids. Until then, we should really push to get generic and specific skills taught to improve student's skills but also science, as better software (code) makes better research.
